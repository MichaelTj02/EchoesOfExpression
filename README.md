This system transforms handwritten text into AI-generated artwork using emotion and cultural interpretation. A reactive agent system gradually draws the image onto a communal canvas, representing collective expression and interconnectedness.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Only input one image at a time.**  
  Submitting multiple images simultaneously may crash the system.

- **OpenAI API Key needed to run the system.**  
  The system relies on OpenAI's GPT-4o for its OCR and NLP system so a key is needed. Create a .env file in the folder and put your key inside.

- **System requirements**  
  Running this system locally requires Python 3.9 or later, at least 16GB of RAM, and a GPU with a minimum of 6GB VRAM (such as an NVIDIA RTX 2060 or higher) to support Stable Diffusion 2.1.
